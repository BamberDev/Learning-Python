[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
I'm off the grid (Homicide, homicide, what?)
Got tats on my ribs (Ah), tattoos on my ribs (What?)
I just tattеd my kid, Onyx (Slatt)
I just threw twenty K on thesе ****, we was at Onyx (Ah, what?)
I just bought me some brand new clothes, Dover Street Market (Givenchy)
Ayy, we just took the route to Charlotte (Yeah, ah, what? Yeah)
I'm in the Rolls-Royce **** on—what you call it? (Yeah, yeah)
I light a opp blunt and let your **** try it (Ah)
Uh, them off the grid, I'm on a **** diet (What?)
