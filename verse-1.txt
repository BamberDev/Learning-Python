[Verse 1: Kanye West & Playboi Carti]
Everything we did, how we live (What?)
All this smoke got a scent
All that smoke heaven sent (Scent)
Everything I spoke, what I meant (Ah)
Never disguise my intent, lines outside the event
Brought my life out the trench
God, thank God, look what He did, did, did, did, did, did
We off the grid, grid, grid, grid, grid (Ayy)
What?
We off the grid, grid, grid, grid
