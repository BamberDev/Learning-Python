[Verse 3: Fivio Foreign]
Yeah, look, when I was in jail, I was lowkey (Uh)
Shout out to supporters that wrote me
Eat food, work out and then go sleep
You know I'm prayin', He carryin' both feet (Yeah)
**** know we got God with us (God with us)
You look at me and see a God figure (Uh)
And when I start vibin', I know that He with me
And I'ma always catch a hard shiver (Uh)
I know it's demons in that dark liquor (Uh)
We buy a bottle and squash with ya (Uh)
Everybody turn into a harsh ****
But my pockets bigger and my heart richer (Uh)
My mind smarter, my grind harder (Skrr)
And my car quicker (Skrrt)
I met her in church, she pray for me
She my God-sister (She my God-sister, yeah)
I'm only trustin' the people I keep close
**** sellin' they soul for a repost
Remember when I was broke, wearin' cheap coats
Now it's diamonds and houses and C notes (Uh)
****, I'm feelin' marvelous (I'm feelin' marvelous)
Who let the monster loose? (Who let the monster loose? Huh)
They call me a product of my environment (Uh)
I tell them, "Nah, I'm what God produced" (Baow)
Defense good, and them guards can shoot (Baow)
I put 'em on you, it get hard to move
Tattoo in my face is the mark of truth
Gotta watch what you say when they market you (Huh)
I already predicted this (I already predicted this, huh)
Y'all only witnessed it (Y'all only witnessed it)
Look, got a couple old friends that I'm not really clickin' with
I know they pray that we settle our differences
I pray that they lower all my **** sentences
I got some demons I'm not even dealin' with
They in they feelings, I'm not really feelin' it
And I know some members that gave back they membership
****, you switched up, huh, like how you not feelin' me?
Look, I act like I care, but I don't really care
Now I live in a new buildin' with amenities
I got a new ceilin' with a chimney
I got a few **** wanna finish me
I don't get too friendly with the enemy
You gotta move different when you in the industry, woo, yeah
You gotta move different when you in the industry, huh
You gotta move different when you in the, look
God blessed me with amazing grace (Uh)
She fell in love with my day to day (Uh)
I just want my problems to fade away (Uh)
Man, I'm tired of ****, I need Gatorade
Boy, I got on my feet and I made a name
And I made it a necklace, huh
When you from the bottom and you workin' hard
Just to get to the top, then they gotta respect it
If you got a voice, then you gotta project it
If you got a wrong, then you gotta correct it
If you got a name, then you gotta protect it
If you give me shock, then you gotta electric (Woo)
Tryna live a new life, so I got a new plan that I gotta finesse with (Look, yeah)
'Cause they want me to lose, they ain't part of the Woos
I been tryin' so hard not to move reckless
[Chorus: Kanye West]
We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid, kid
Everything we did for the crib did here
Flexinâ€™ with the business trip
Going cray, take some G6 (Ah)
Lit, lit, '76
He split lids, then ask for shade, tsk-tsk-tsk
Take this trip, trip, trip, this, this
This, this, this, this
You all still lit, lit, lit
I'm off the grid, grid, grid, grid
Off the grid, grid, grid, grid
